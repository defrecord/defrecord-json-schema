They were serving a cupcake called the 'Mr. President' that had an Oreo cookie inside. When I tried to point out the racism implied, they claimed that 'our current president loves Oreos.'\"</p>\n<p>When we called to ask Anjelica Hayes, the owner of Fat Cupcake, about the accusations of racism, she responded, \"I have been asked this so many times.\"</p>\n<p>She said over the phone Monday, unequivocally, that she isn't racist.</p>\n<p>For one thing, she said, \"I myself am black.\"</p>\n<p>Hayes said she is a born and raised Portlander. She said she is very involved in the community and has even started something she called, \"our 'Piece of Cake' movement.\"</p>\n<p>\"We have driven around Portland to give away cakes to the homeless,\" she said, \"and donated thousands of cupcakes to the community.\"</p>\n<p>Hayes told us that the name for the cupcake came because she wanted to call it something to honor what a great cupcake it is.</p>\n<p>\"What sounds like it would be really fancy?\" she said. \"We thought of the presidential office.\"</p>\n<p>\"I just thought it was an honorary name,\" she said. \"I thought I'd be honored if someone named a cupcake after me.\"</p>\n<p>She said that at one point someone told her that President Barack Obama's favorite cookie was the Oreo. \"So we thought that was a cool coincidence,\" she said.</p>\n<p>But since opening in Southeast Portland, Hayes said she's had to field questions about whether her cupcakes are racist. She also has a cupcake called \"The Intern\" that the same customer quoted above on Yelp took to be a slam on Monica Lewinsky. Hayes said it is not.</p>\n<p>At least until the election is over, Hayes said, they have changed the name of the cupcake to a more generic title: \"The Professional.\"</p>\n<p>She said the cupcake, whatever it's called, is one of the store's most popular items.</p>\n<p>--&nbsp;Lizzy Acker</p>\n<p>503-221-8052<br> <a href=\"mailto:lacker@oregonian.com\">lacker@oregonian.com</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizzzyacker\">@lizzzyacker</a></p>",

At this point of this season, I wouldn't.</p>\n<p>I saw Oregon State beat Cal Saturday night by playing with the pride, poise and passion that seem to be lacking in Eugene.</p>\n<p>So, what does it mean?</p>\n<p>Maybe it's one of those seasons that has become a perfect storm of recruiting misses, poor veteran leadership and opponents who have been waiting eagerly for an opportunity to get their licks in on a program many believe was getting a little big for its britches.</p>\n<p>Stuff happens, you know?</p>\n<p>Sometimes the best way to fix things isn't to go into Celebrity Apprentice mode and fire everybody in sight.</p>\n<p>That can take a one-season problem and make it worse.</p>\n<p>Some say Oregon's descent began last year with defensive breakdowns in losses to Utah, Washington State and in the Alamo Bowl to TCU.</p>\n<p>UO coach Mark Helfrich attempted to address that by changing defensive coordinators and switching schemes.</p>\n<p>It's too early to pull the plug on the scheme. Defensive coordinator Brady Hoke hasn't had the opportunity to bring in the players to implement it.</p>\n<p>Many current UO coaches were part of the staff during the golden run in which the Ducks twice played in the national title game. I don't believe they became incompetent in the interim.</p>\n<p>If you think Chip Kelly is solely responsible for Oregon's recent success, you have to wonder what has happened to Kelly's coaching brilliance since he migrated to the NFL.</p>\n<p>Kelly was fired from the Eagles and currently is 1-4 with the 49ers.</p>\n<p>Look, I think Kelly is a very good coach. Maybe a great one. I covered the Ducks for two seasons when he was head coach. I thought he was a football savant.</p>\n<p>But sometimes it's not all on the head coach.</p>\n<p>OK, more links:</p>\n<p>The Ducks sink to the cellar; <a

		"body": "<p>The principal of Lincoln High School in September told administrators that she felt she needed \"to retain a lawyer\" over \"repeated harassment and retaliation\" from the Portland school board's vice chair.</p>\n<p>The accusation was among more than 200 emails released by Portland Public Schools on Monday, weeks after Lincoln students walked off their campus to protest&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2016/07/why_the_portland_school_board.html\" target=\"_blank\">the board's delay of a $750 million bond measure.</a></p>\n<p>The emails offer fresh insight into tensions that followed the protest, which sparked controversy when the district<a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2016/09/portland_public_schools_called.html\" target=\"_blank\"> put Benson High School in \"lockout\"</a> after Lincoln students showed up outside.</p>\n<p>A group of 20, including parents and media organizations, asked for the records Sept. 12. The district released emails, but not text messages also sought from board members. The school district's attorney, Stephanie Harper, said \"that request is not denied, however\" \u2014 but questioned how the request \"is related to the public interest.\"</p>\n<p>Lincoln High School Principal Peyton Chapman emailed three high-level district employees after the walkout to document a meeting with them and relay concerns she was being \"systematically harassed\" by School Board Vice Chair Amy Kohnstamm.</p>\n<p>Chapman wrote Kohnstamm \"verbally attacked\" her after the Sept. 7 lockout for \"having the 'highest levels of arrogance' she has ever seen and for not agreeing with her perspective.\"</p>\n<p>Previously, Chapman had publicly urged the board to place the bond on the November ballot. The board, in a 4-3 vote, decided to aim for the May ballot instead.</p>\n<div id=\"DV-viewer-3130943-PPS-Lockout-Emails\" class=\"DV-container\"></div>\n<script src=\"//assets.documentcloud.org/viewer/loader.js\"></script>\n<script>// <![CDATA[\n  DV.load(\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3130943-PPS-Lockout-Emails.js\", {\n  width: 620,\n    height: 450,\n    sidebar: false,\n    text: false,\n    container: \"#DV-viewer-3130943-PPS-Lockout-Emails\"\n  });\n// ]]></script>\n<noscript>\n  &lt;a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3130943/PPS-Lockout-Emails.pdf\"&gt;PPS-Lockout-Emails (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;br /&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3130943/PPS-Lockout-Emails.txt\"&gt;PPS-Lockout-Emails (Text)&lt;/a&gt;\n</noscript>\n<p>Chapman said in an interview that she's since told the district to drop the matter and is not pursuing any harassment claims against Kohnstamm.</p>\n<p>\"That was a really intense time period because we are both really passionate about school facilities and we had different views on the timing of that,\" Chapman said. \"We both realized the most important thing was to advance needed improvements for our schools. We have a history of working really closely together.\"</p>\n<p>Chapman would not detail how the district handled her concerns&nbsp;but said she met with several district officials and felt at ease.</p>\n<p>\"That was a very stressful day for Peyton and sometimes people say things when emotions are running high,\" Kohnstamm said in a text message Monday. \"She's a terrific principal and we will both devote ourselves to getting our bond passed.\"</p>\n<p>Chapman wrote that she wanted to document, in the meeting with the administrators, that she was told she was being investigated over the walkout.</p>\n<p>\"You have asked me not to talk to students to avoid perceptions of tainting their testimony which of course I would never do,\" Chapman wrote. \"You also informed me that you would be researching employee's free speech rights as you were not sure what rights principals have.\"</p>\n<p>Antonio Lopez, the district's superintendent for the Office of School Performance, denied Chapman was under investigation in his reply. He was in the meeting along with Senior Director of Schools Oscar Gilson and Director of Academic Programs Greg Wolleck.</p>\n<p>\"I did not say you are being investigated, what I said was that we are investigating the situation to see how it came about and the lessons we can learn from it,\" Lopez wrote.</p>\n<p>As to Chapman's concerns about Kohnstamm, Lopez wrote that it was his job to relay them to Interim Superintendent Bob McKean.</p>\n<p>In her email, Chapman said Kohnstamm had harassed her since Chapman wrote <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2016/08/our_kids_deserve_an_answer_on.html\">an opinion piece</a> in favor of the November ballot. After the piece ran, Chapman said, Kohnstamm sent her text messages claiming Chapman was trying to \"undermine her\" and \"sabotage her leadership.\"</p>\n<p>The decision to push the bond to May emerged as a flashpoint because board members had been planning until late July to aim for November. The about-face came as a surprise to some in the community \u2014&nbsp;just days before, the board's bond committee had publicly supported a November bond.</p>\n<p>Board members were criticized for not publicly discussing the reasoning behind the sudden change and in September, students forced a conversation by threatening a sit-in of a board meeting.</p>\n<p>The walkout the next day became controversial when Lincoln students decided to head to Benson. Both schools would benefit from the bond. Police guarded the doors at Benson, and McKean ordered the school under a \"lockout\" to prevent Lincoln students from entering the school.</p>\n<p>The sight of officers outside Benson, and signs inside Benson saying students should remain inside, led students, parents and civil rights groups to question why students at a mostly white, affluent school seemed to be free to protest while a school serving less-privileged students appeared to be holding students hostage.</p>\n<p>Administrators said Benson students were free to leave, heightening tensions. Many complained the statement was disingenuous and inaccurate as the signs and the district's own lock out policy stated otherwise.</p>\n<p>The emails released Monday show senior administrators sought editing from a communications consultant, Anna Richter Taylor, before releasing a statement on the lockout to students at both schools.</p>\n<p>At one point, on Sept. 12, Richter Taylor told district chief of staff Amanda Whalen in an email that \"from all press accounts the district looks not so great.\"</p>\n<p>McKean's statement after the unrest <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2016/09/portland_superintendent_respon.html\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledged unclear communication</a>&nbsp;and room for improvement, but maintained the lockout had been the right call at the time and noted the doors were not actually locked.</p>\n<p>McKean has since met with student leaders, who have said publicly they're hopeful the incident was a learning experience for the district.</p>\n<p>-- Bethany Barnes</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:bbarnes@oregonian.com\">bbarnes@oregonian.com</a></p>",

It was small and a lot of people went home,\" he said. \"When I played there, I planned on staying there all five years. It was still college football and still a blessing to play.\"</p>\n<p>But the itch to try to aim for something more never left him, and Sattelmaier decided to head to Palomar College (San Marcos, California) in the hopes of impressing an FCS or FBS program.</p>\n<p>Just five games in to his junior college season, Oregon State called and pulled the trigger, offering the behemoth a scholarship.</p>\n<p>Sattelmaier is expected to come in an compete for the back-up role at either left or right tackle, but could earn a starting spot as he develops.</p>\n<p>For Oregon State, the commitment marks the third offensive line pledge in the class of 2017, joining Central Catholic's Travis Mackay and Washington product Brock Wellsfry.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.hudl.com/embed/video/3/3117300/57f2df320aff7a728037842d\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>--&nbsp;<a href=\"http://connect.oregonlive.com/staff/a-nemec/posts.html\"><strong>Andrew Nemec</strong></a><br>anemec@oregonian.com<br>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec\"><strong>AndrewNemec</strong></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",

Everybody does it!</p>\n<p>So went Donald Trump's argument Sunday when he was asked about his 1995 federal tax return, which was leaked to the press last week. \"Warren Buffett took a massive deduction,\" the Republican nominee said during the second presidential debate.</p>\n<p>Really? Buffett, the billionaire investor known as the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" wants to set the record straight.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Trump says he knows more about taxes than any other human,\" <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161010005859/en/Tax-Facts-Donald-Trump\">Buffett said in a statement on Monday</a>. \"He has not seen my income tax returns. But I am happy to give him the facts.\"</p>\n<p>Buffett says he has paid federal income tax every year since he was 13 years old -- that is, since 1944. \"I have copies of all 72 of my returns and none uses a carryforward,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Buffett, who backs Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and whose outrage at tax loopholes for the wealthy inspired the \"Buffett Rule\" (a proposal that would require anyone making $1 million or more to pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal taxes), also called on Trump to release his tax returns. Trump, who says he will not release his returns because he's under federal audit, is the first major-party presidential nominee in more than 30 years to keep his taxes under wraps.</p>\n<p>\"I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited,\" Buffett said. \"I have no problem in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump -- at least he would have no <em>legal</em> problem.\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-- Douglas Perry</p>\n<iframe src=\"//www.facebook.com/plugins/follow?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdouglasperryoregon&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=true&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;width=450&amp;height=80\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; width: 450px; height: 80px;\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>",
